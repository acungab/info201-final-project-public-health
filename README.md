# Info201 Final Project

## **Our Purpose for this Project:**

  One of the main words leading our research for this project is: Discovery. We all live in the United States, but we asked ourselves how much do we really know about it?
  A lot of people here at the University of Washington are only focused on school and what is next, which leads to the lack of understanding of what is happening around them.
  Our group had the chance to do a deep dive into what the United States is made up, and most importantly what type of people live around us. We walk around everyday and do not
  see what type of people make up our local community let alone our country. As a team one of our main goals was to show people the demographics that surround us everyday.
  One of our guiding questions was what makes up Washington State, our own state we living in. We found how diverse it actually is, having different counties with reservations
  and prominent native Hawaiian population where others have little to none

  From what we found looking at Washington State, we asked ourselves why stop there? Going a little bigger we looked at the whole United States population and saw how each race
  was very present in each and every state, and how overall most races were increasing in numbers. Looking how the population is growing we went to the state level to examine
  how each state was doing on an expansionary scale. While most state fall under stage 2 of expansionary population some are at stage 3 meaning the middle population is bigger
  than the younger population meaning the growth is at a halt. If this continues it would mean that the overall United States population would decline in the future. This is
  important to realize because it could lead to both social and economic problems in our society.

  The purpose of this project was to discover what's beyond our university walls. This project gave us inspiration to learn more about our society and how important diversity is within and
  outside our community. Overall, this taught us the values of learning about different racial and social groups and we all are excited to keep learning and sharing this topic.
